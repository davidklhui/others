This repo contains slot game stochastic modeling / simulations projects:
All of the followings are involved Probability and Simulations

1. [Stochsatic Simulations Spin Poker](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidklhui/stochastic-modelling/blob/main/Stochastic_Simulations_Spin_Poker.ipynb)
      - The very first project I conducted to find payout allocation depends on player behavior
      - highlights: used Integer Programming
2. [Discussion of Basic 3x3 Slot Design](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidklhui/stochastic-modelling/blob/main/Discussion_of_basic_3x3_Slot_design.ipynb)
      - Demonstrate a 3x3 slot game design using RTP and Hit Frequency
      - highlights: used Dirichlet Distribution to complete automatically find feasible solution satisfying RTP and HF ranges
3. [Discussion of Basic 5x3 Slot Design](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidklhui/stochastic-modelling/blob/main/Discussion_of_basic_5x3_Slot_design.ipynb)
      - Demonstrate a 5x3 slot game design using RTP and Hit Frequency
      - highlights: used Dirichlet Distribution; theoretical calculation of probability distributions of different paylines
4. [Slot Design using Markov Chains](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidklhui/stochastic-modelling/blob/main/Slot_design_using_Markov_Chains.ipynb)
      - highlights: Markov Chains and Limiting Distribution
5. [Discussion of Further 5x3 Slot Design](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidklhui/stochastic-modelling/blob/main/Discussion_of_further_5x3_Slot_design.ipynb)
      - Demonstrate a further 5x3 slot game design using RTP and Hit Frequency, including Wild symbol
      - highlights: used Dirichlet Distribution
