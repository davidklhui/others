This repo contains slot game stochastic modeling / simulations projects:
All of the followings are involved Probability and Simulations

1. Stochsatic Simulations Spin Poker
      - The very first project I conducted to find payout allocation depends on player behavior
      - highlights: used Integer Programming
2. Discussion of Basic 3x3 Slot Design
      - Demonstrate a 3x3 slot game design using RTP and Hit Frequency
      - highlights: used Dirichlet Distribution to complete automatically find feasible solution satisfying RTP and HF ranges
3. Discussion of Basic 5x3 Slot Design
      - Demonstrate a 5x3 slot game design using RTP and Hit Frequency
      - highlights: used Dirichlet Distribution; theoretical calculation of probability distributions of different paylines
4. Slot Design using Markov Chains
      - highlights: Markov Chains and Limiting Distribution
5. Discussion of Further 5x3 Slot Design
      - Demonstrate a further 5x3 slot game design using RTP and Hit Frequency, including Wild symbol
      - highlights: used Dirichlet Distribution
